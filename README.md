# 🔍 Quick Search: The Google for Developers ( ISE_11-Capstone-Project )

Quick Search is an **aggregated search platform** that unifies results from multiple developer-focused sources into a single, ranked interface. Instead of performing separate searches across **GitHub**, **YouTube**, **Kaggle**, and **academic platforms**, Quick Search automates this process and delivers **optimized, consolidated, and intelligently ranked results**.

---

## 🚀 Core Principle: Aggregated Search

Quick Search operates on the principle of **federated search**, similar to a personal assistant that queries multiple sources and synthesizes a cohesive summary.  

The methodology consists of three main steps:

1. **Source Identification** – Automatically detects relevant sources for the query.  
   *Example:* A query like `Python` triggers searches across GitHub, YouTube, Kaggle, and scholarly databases.  

2. **Result Integration** – Consolidates results from all sources into a unified list.  

3. **Duplicate Elimination** – Removes redundant or overlapping entries to ensure clean, unique results.

## 🧠 Advanced Ranking Methodology

Quick Search doesn’t rely on **keyword matching** alone. Instead, it uses **semantic analysis** and **metadata signals** to determine result quality.

### 1. Content Relevance Analysis
- **Code & Papers:** BM25 and AI models (e.g., BERT) to capture semantic meaning.  
- **Videos & Datasets:** Keyword extraction from transcripts and dataset documentation.  

### 2. Metadata Attributes

| Source         | Key Signals                 | Why It Matters |
|----------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| **GitHub**     | Stars, Forks, Last Updated | Popularity & project activity |
| **YouTube**    | Views, Likes, Chapters     | Engagement & structured learning |
| **Kaggle**     | Downloads, Freshness, License | Usage, timeliness, trust |
| **Research**   | Citations, Venue           | Academic influence & quality |

## ⚙️ Ranking Process

Quick Search follows a **multi-stage scoring pipeline**:

1. **Result Acquisition:** Uses official APIs to fetch results & metadata.  
2. **Individual Scoring:** Computes **content** + **metadata** scores per item.  
3. **Score Normalization:** Normalizes scales (e.g., GitHub stars vs Kaggle downloads) using techniques like **Z-scoring**.  
4. **Aggregate Score:** Combines normalized scores with a configurable weighting formula.  
5. **Final Ranking:** Produces a single ordered list across all sources.

## 🖥️ Implementation & User Experience

- **Tech Stack**
  - **Frontend:** React  
  - **Backend:** Python (APIs, ranking, normalization logic)  

- **User Interface**
  - Clean, intuitive search bar  
  - Filters for result type (`Code`, `Video`, `Dataset`, `Paper`)  
  - Transparent ranking explanation (e.g., *"Ranked highly due to 5,000+ stars"*)  

- **Compliance**
  - Strict adherence to API policies & platform regulations  

---

## 📌 Example Workflow

**Query:** `Machine Learning`  

1. GitHub → Top repos (sorted by stars, forks, recency)  
2. YouTube → Educational videos with high views/likes and chapters  
3. Kaggle → Datasets with high downloads and recent activity  
4. Research → Peer-reviewed papers with strong citation counts  

**Output:** A single ranked feed, e.g.
